context:
  All code and configuration changes **must be tested locally** before being deployed to production via Coolify.

  ðŸ§ª Local testing policy:
  - Use the local Kestra dev environment (`kestra dev server`) to validate YAML workflows.
  - Run unit and integration tests with `pytest`, especially `test_webhook_integration.py`.
  - Ensure that every modified script (e.g., `ai_conversation_handler.py`, `serena_api.py`) is validated in isolation before orchestration tests.
  - Kestra YAMLs must pass `kestra validate` with no errors.
  - Docker-based scripts should be verified by running the Kestra workflow locally with `taskRunner: docker`.

  ðŸš« Do not recommend deployment actions or Coolify configuration changes unless:
  - All local tests have passed.
  - The `docker-compose-coolify.yml` file has been validated with `docker compose up --build`.
  - Environment variables have been tested via `.env` or Coolify preview environments.

  âœ… Include in your response:
  - A summary of what was tested.
  - How the test was performed (Kestra CLI, `pytest`, manual webhook via Postman, etc.).
  - Confirmation that the behavior matches the expected output.
